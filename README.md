<i class="fas fa-wind"></i> AI-Text-HooverAI-Text-Hoover is a high-utility, privacy-focused web application designed to "suck up" the conversational noise and formatting artifacts often found in AI-generated text. It allows users to quickly transform raw AI output into clean, professional, and human-ready content.🚀 The MissionWhen you copy text from AI platforms, it often arrives with unwanted "robot noise" that requires manual editing. AI-Text-Hoover provides a "one-click suction" experience to remove these elements instantly:Conversational Bookends: Intros like "Certainly! Here is..." and closures like "I hope this helps!"Markdown Clutter: Excessive bolding (**), headers (#), and code backticks.Repetitive Clichés: Overused transition phrases like "Moreover," or "In conclusion."✨ Key Features🧹 Hoover OpeningsTargets the first few lines of a response to delete conversational fluff.Identifies: "Certainly! I can help with that," "Here is a simple guide to...", and more.✂️ Hoover Closures (Cutoff Logic)Acts as a cutoff switch. Once it identifies the start of an AI sign-off (e.g., "If you'd like, I can also provide..."), it deletes everything from that line until the end of the document.💎 Structural ScrubbingStrip Markdown: Cleanly removes bold, italics, and header symbols while preserving the text.Normalize Spacing: Collapses irregular line breaks and double spaces into a standard document flow.🧠 Flow Optimizer (Cliche Killer)Scans for high-frequency AI transition words (e.g., "Ultimately," "Tapestry of...") that signal "generated content" to a human reader.🛠️ Technical StackFrontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSSTypography: Space GroteskLogic: Vanilla JavaScript / Regular Expressions (Regex)Privacy: 100% Client-Side.
